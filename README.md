I want facts. Quick. (aka Impatient Programmers Abstract)

* Adds customizable banner to both Backend and Frontend with environment identifier (e.g. DEV)
* Prepends environment identifier to the Frontend page title
* Works both for Typo3 4.x and 6.x
* Early alpha, please use with care!
* I'm happy to get feedback or bugfixes! Just drop me an email: carsten@carstenwindler.de

Super quick install guide
---
**Important:** You need to save the configuration once, otherwise envbanner will do nothing (because it's a polite extension).

* Install the extension via the Extension Manager
* Upon installation, the Extension Manager will show you the configuration screen
* If not, while still in the Extension Manager, switch to the Configuration tab, edit settings according to your needs (you don't have to for a quick trial, it works out of the box),
* hit "Update" button in any case
* Reload Frontend and Backend

About this extension
---
This extension was build for those who often work on multiple Typo3 projects at the same time, or who are working with Staging/Production servers and accidently made changes on the wrong system and wondered why the changes did not work as expected.
